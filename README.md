> **A luxury mobile-first e-commerce experience designed for the future of sensory technology.**

**Live Demo:** [https://lumos-puce.vercel.app](https://lumos-puce.vercel.app)

Lumos is a high-performance web application that bridges the gap between native mobile apps and the responsive web. It features gesture-based navigation, cinematic motion depth, and a complex state management system for handling overlay stacking contexts (Cart, Search, Menu).

## ✨ Key Features

* **🛒 "App-Like" Navigation:** A horizontal snap-scroll feed that mimics native touch interactions, with smart fallback controls for desktop users.
* **🔍 Command Palette Search:** A global search overlay that filters products in real-time without page reloads, featuring a "Smart Switch" logic to handle multiple open overlays.
* **💨 Magic Motion:** Powered by **Framer Motion**, elements physically slide and morph between states (like the floating "Dynamic Island" navigation).
* **🏎️ Next.js 16:** Built on React Server Components for instant initial loads and SEO optimization.
* **🎨 Cinematic UI:** Infinite marquee, parallax depth effects, and luxury-grade typography.
